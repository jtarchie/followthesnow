# Follow the snow

This is the app that builds the static site for Follow the Snow. It goes through
a list of ski resorts and locations to get the snow report (inches fallen).

## Usage

Building the site will take awhile. The OpenWeather API is used to get
information about current and upcoming snow conditions. They rate limit pretty
heavily, so a `sleep` is put in between every API call.

This will manually build the site.

```bash
bundle install
rake build # or rake fast
ruby -run -ehttpd docs/ -p8000
```

Then commit the changed pages, which will be deployed as a static site via
Github Pages and Cloudflare.

The page is build every morning from 6am MST, so that latest snow totals for the
day are available. This is using
[Github Actions](https://github.com/jtarchie/followthesnow/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)
to do so.

### Test

Everything is tested because it should be.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## GitHub Copilot

This repository includes custom instructions for GitHub Copilot in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`. These instructions help Copilot generate
code that follows our conventions and best practices.

If you're using GitHub Copilot, it will automatically reference these
instructions when making suggestions. Contributors should update the
instructions file when introducing new patterns or conventions to the codebase.

## Sources

All the resorts are in CSV files in `resorts/` by country. They are scraped via
`rake scrape` from respective Wikipedia pages.

### Notes

Exploring getting information from website via scraping. Haven't done it because
it would cost money.

```javascript
document.body.querySelectorAll(
  "nav,header,footer,form,button,iframe,script,[role]",
).forEach((node) => node.remove());
document.body.textContent.trim().replace(/\s+/g, " ");
```
