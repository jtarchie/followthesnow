# About

Follow the Snow's story began with a memorable ski day when a friend and I
decided to follow the snow and ended up having the best ski day ever in
Steamboat Springs instead of Winter Park. This inspired us to create a website
that provides snow forecasts for all ski resorts in the United States and
Canada.

Our website uses freely available weather data to present quick views of todayâ€™s
snowfall and predictions for the following week. We designed the site to be easy
to access even with poor cell coverage, so it always remains minimal.

We believe that everyone should have access to this information without any
cost, which is why we don't charge anything. Our team is dedicated to providing
this valuable service by investing our time and resources.

If you have any suggestions for additional information that would be useful,
please don't hesitate to click the contact button on our navigation bar.
