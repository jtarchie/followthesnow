<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About</h2>

<p>Started on March 6th, 2022.</p>

<p>This website was born from a spontaneous adventure a friend and I embarked on during a snowy day. En route to Winter
  Park in Colorado, we checked the forecast and discovered an exceptional powder day unfolding at Steamboat Springs.
  Seizing the moment, we detoured for a three-hour drive, experienced one of our best ski days, and still managed to
  return in time for dinner.</p>

<p>This experience sparked a conversation about creating a website dedicated to guiding skiers to the best snow
  conditions each day. As we drove, the realization hit us: we were simply following the snow. And that became the essence
  of our website's name and purpose.</p>
