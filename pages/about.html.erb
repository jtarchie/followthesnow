<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About</h2>

<p>It started on March 6th, 2022.</p>

<p>This website sprang to life from an impromptu escapade a friend and I embarked on during a snowy day. En route to Winter Park in Colorado, we checked the forecast and stumbled upon an extraordinary powder day unfolding at Steamboat Springs. Embracing the unexpected, we rerouted for a thrilling three-hour drive, savored one of our most memorable ski days, and returned for dinner.</p>

<p>This experience sparked a conversation about creating a website that guides skiers daily to the best snow conditions. As we drove, we realized we were following the snow. And that became the essence of our website's name and purpose.</p>
