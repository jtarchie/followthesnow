<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About</h2>

<p>It began quietly on March 6th, 2022.</p>

<p>On a snowy morning a friend and I were driving toward Winter Park, Colorado. We noticed the forecast looked better around Steamboat Springs, decided to take the longer route, spent a pleasant afternoon skiing, and came home with a nice memory.</p>

<p>That simple trip inspired a small idea: a straightforward site to help skiers find where conditions might be better. Follow the Snow grew out of that practical goal — a modest project to share useful information with fellow skiers.</p>
